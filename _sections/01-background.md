title: Background
description: Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR) can be measured with BOLD functional MRI and induced with Breath-Hold (BH) in a highly reliable way. However, the reliability of BH-induced CVR, frequently expressed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), is not constant across the whole brain, possibly suggesting regional state-like or trait-like driving factors. While it is possible that the neural activations elicited by the BH task are responsible for regional differences in CVR reliability, we hypothesize that the observed spatial patterns of long-term stability are associated with the vascular architecture of the brain.

The estimation of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) can be a valuable assessment in the clinical routine. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) contrast is commonly used for CVR mapping studies, and a non-invasive way to implement BOLD-CVR measurements is to adopt voluntary respiratory challenges, such as breath-hold (BH) tasks [1]⁠. A BH task induces the subject in a state of hypercapnia that causes a transient increase in blood flow and the BOLD signal, similar to CO2 gas challenges [2]⁠. BH-induced CVR can be assessed despite inconsistent subject performance [3]⁠, and it can be successfully implemented in many types of populations [4,5]⁠. More importantly, it was shown that measuring BH-induced CVR with BOLD-fMRI is highly reliable [3,6–10⁠]. However, the reliability of BH-induced CVR, frequently expressed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), is not constant across the whole brain, possibly suggesting regional state-like or trait-like driving factors. Local variability has been observed not only across different brain tissues, but also across hemispheres and between cortical and subcortical areas [8,10⁠]. The same observation can be extended to the CVR response lag [10⁠]. 
Despite these observations, little is known about which factors induce this regionally-specific reliability. Therefore, in this study we inspect how different architectures of the brain (e.g. a vascular architecture vs a functional network architecture) can specifically explain local differences in the long-term stability of CVR (i.e. be more homogeneous). We use three different atlases, one based on functional networks11⁠⁠, one based on vascular anatomy (arterial flow territories) [12]⁠, and one based on anatomical subcortical and cerebellar parcellation [13]⁠, to investigate if local CVR reliability is specific to certain regions of interests (ROI).
While it is possible that the neural activations elicited by the BH task are responsible for regional differences in CVR reliability, we hypothesize that the observed spatial patterns of long-term stability are associated with the vascular architecture of the brain. As such, we expect that ROIs circumscribing vascular territories will demonstrate more specific (i.e. homogeneous) reliability as compared to functional or anatomical ROIs.
